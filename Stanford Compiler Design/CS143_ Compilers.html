				The <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs143/cs143.1128/handouts/250%20Assignment%204.pdf">final programming assignment</a> (IR generation) is out and is due on <b>Saturday, August 18</b> at <b>11:30 AM</b> (note the time change).  Once you've completed this assignment, you'll have a full working compiler for Decaf.  Isn't that cool? 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a logistical note, be aware that there will be <b>no late submissions allowed</b> for this assignment.  The due date for pp4 is the latest possible time that we can have assignments due, so please try to get it in on time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Good luck!

This assignment is broken into two portions - a checkpoint assignment due on Monday, July 30 at 11:59PM (hard deadline), and the main assignment, which is due on Monday, August 6 at 11:59PM.  In this assignment, you will perform the final set of checks necessary to confirm that the input program is indeed well-formed, setting the stage for IR generation in the next assignment.
			</p>
			<p>
				This assignment is substantially larger than the previous assignments, so be sure to start early.

			<p> 
				The CS143 midterm exam is next Wednesday, July 25, from 11:00AM - 1:00PM.  We'll meet in the normal room (Thornton 102).  The exam covers the material up to and including Earley parsing, with an emphasis on scanning, LL, and LR parsing.  The exam is open-book, open-note, open-computer, but closed-network, meaning that you can have the slides and other notes available during the exam.  You just can't go Googling the answers.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs143/cs143.1128/handouts/200%20Practice%20CS143%20Midterm.pdf">practice exam</a> available, which is the exam that was given last summer quarter.  The structure and content of this exam is similar to that of the upcoming exam.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are taking this class remotely, you will receive an electronic copy of the exam at around 11:00AM on July 25 and can start taking the exam any time between 11:00AM on July 25 and 11:00AM on July 26.  You should return the exam to us no later than 1:00PM on July 26, and we'll include submission instructions along with the exam itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				There will be a review session on Monday, so please feel free to show up with questions!

		<div class="announcement"> 
			<p> 
				Windows starter files for the second programming project are now available.  To use them, you will need to follow these instructions:
			</p>
			<ol>
			<li> Download the <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/gnuwin32/bison/2.4.1/bison-2.4.1-setup.exe?r=http%3A%2F%2Fgnuwin32.sourceforge.net%2Fpackages%2Fbison.htm&amp;ts=1341786261&amp;use_mirror=voxel">Windows version of <tt>bison</tt></a>.  When prompted for an installation directory, <b>do not use the default directory</b>.  Instead, install <tt>bison</tt> to <tt>C:\GnuWin32</tt>, not in "Program Files."  This is due to a bug in the <tt>bison</tt> implementation that causes it not to work correctly if it's placed in a directory whose name contains a space.</li>
			<li> Download the <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/gnuwin32/sed/4.2.1/sed-4.2.1-setup.exe?r=&amp;ts=1341786285&amp;use_mirror=iweb">Windows version of <tt>sed</tt> and <tt>m4</tt></a>.  When prompted for an installation directory, <b>do not use the default directory</b>.  Instead, install <tt>bison</tt> to <tt>C:\GnuWin32</tt>, not in "Program Files."</li>
			<li> Download the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs143/cs143.1128/assignments/pp2.zip">Windows pp2 starter project</a>.  The project should be all set up to go, so if you're encountering any problems please let us know so we can try to fix them.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				If you do your development work in Windows, you will still need to submit using the existing submissions framework.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hope this helps!

It's due on Friday, July 20 at 11:59PM.  In this assignment, you will build up the parser for Decaf, and will learn how to use the <tt>bison</tt> tool in the process.  Additionally, you will get experience introducing new features into the language as you add <tt>switch</tt> statements and a few other extensions to Decaf.
			</p> 
			<p>
				We will be releasing a Windows version of this assignment later today once we've confirmed that our starter project files work correctly.

		<div class="header">Logging in Remotely</div> 
		<div class="date">July 4, 2011</div> 
		<div class="announcement"> 
			<p> 
				Several of you have asked how to log in to the Stanford machines remotely.  To do so, you will need an SSH client.  On
				Linux or Mac computers, you can do this from the command-line with <tt>ssh</tt>.  On Windows, you will need to download
				a SSH client such as <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> or SecureCRT (available with
				your SUNetID <a href="https://itservices.stanford.edu/service/ess/pc"><b>here</b></a>).  From there, you will want to
				connect to either <tt>myth.stanford.edu</tt> or <tt>corn.stanford.edu</tt>. You will probably get a warning about a RSA 
				key not matching, which is perfectly fine; these above hostnames will forward you to a free machine on the cluster. From
				 there, you should be good to go!
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're having trouble logging in, or if you have any other questions, as always feel free to contact us.

				Hope this helps!

			<ol>
			<li> Download the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/flex/2.5.4a-1/flex-2.5.4a-1.exe/download">Windows version of flex</a>.

The project should be all set up to go, so if you're encountering any problems please let me know and I can try to fix them.  I built this project using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2008-editions/express">Visual C++ 2008</a>, which is available free for download.</li>
