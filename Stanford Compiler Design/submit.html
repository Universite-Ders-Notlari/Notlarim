		<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
       <p><li> Log into your leland account from one of the workstations.
       <p><li> Make sure that the project you submit compiles cleanly
               by issuing the command "make".  If it has errors during compilation,
               the script will reject your submission and make you submit
               again.  We also frown on code that doesn't compile perfectly
               (i.e. produces warnings); your entire project should make no complaints.
       <p><li> Put a "README" file in your project directory, containing your 
               real name, your leland username, and an e-mail address where 
               we can contact you if we have any problems.  If you have any 
               special comments you want the the grader to know about your 
               submission, please add them here. The README is also a pretty 
               good place to put feedback about the assignments.  Too hard, 
               too long, too easy, too much fun?  TAs also like jokes, but only
               if they are in good taste. :)
       <p><li> From the shell command line, type:
               <pre>/usr/class/cs143/bin/submit </pre>
	       The script will:
	       <ol>
	          <li> Ask you which assignment you are submitting (you will be
	               presented with a list of possible assignments).
	          <li> Ask you for the source directory path.
	          <li> Copy your assignment source files, Makefile (if any),
                       and README, from the current directory to our submit folder.
	          <li> If all goes well, you get the happy "SUCCESS" message.
                       If you get a message that says something else, follow its
                       directions.  If you get stuck, send mail to compilers@cs.stanford.edu.
               </ol>
       <p><li> If you need to resubmit a project because you made later changes, 
               just repeat these directions.  The script will notice if you are 
               attempting to re-submit and will not overwrite your previous
               submission.  We keep all of your submissions, but only the very 
               last submission is graded unless you tell us differently.
