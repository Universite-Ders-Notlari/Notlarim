<p>
PuTTY is a free implementation of SSH and Telnet for Windows and Unix
platforms, along with an <code>xterm</code> terminal emulator. It is
written and maintained primarily by
<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/">Simon Tatham</a>.

<p>
The latest version is 0.74.
<a href="latest.html"><b>Download it here</b></a>.

<p><b>LEGAL WARNING</b>:
Use of PuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink is illegal in countries where
encryption is outlawed. We believe it is legal to use PuTTY, PSCP,
PSFTP and Plink in England and Wales and in many other countries, but
we are not lawyers, and so if in doubt you should seek legal advice
before downloading it. You may find useful information at
<a href="http://www.cryptolaw.org/">cryptolaw.org</a>, which collects
information on cryptography laws in many countries, but we
can't vouch for its correctness.
</p>

<p>
Use of the Telnet-only binary (PuTTYtel) is unrestricted by any
cryptography laws.



<h2>Latest news</h2>

<p>
<b>2021-04-18 Pre-releases of 0.75 now available</b>


<p>
We're working towards a 0.75 release. Pre-release builds are <a
href="prerel.html">available</a>, and we'd appreciate people testing
them and reporting any issues.
<p>
0.75 will be a feature release. The biggest changes all relate to
Pageant and/or SSH public keys. User-visible behaviour changes include:
<ul>
<li>Pageant now allows you to load a key without decrypting it, in
which case it will wait until you first use it to ask for the
passphrase.</li>
<li>We've switched to the modern OpenSSH-style SHA-256 style of key
fingerprint.</li>
</ul>
Back-end changes that affect compatibility:
<ul>
<li>We've added support for the <code>rsa-sha2-256</code> and
<code>rsa-sha2-512</code> signature methods, which some servers now
require in order to use RSA keys.</li>
<li>We've introduced a new version of the PPK format for private key
files, to remove weak crypto and improve password-guessing
resistance.</li>
<li>We've introduced a new method for applications to talk to Pageant
on Windows, based on the same named-pipe system used by connection
sharing instead of window messages.</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>2020-11-22 Primary git branch renamed</b>


<p>
The primary branch in the PuTTY git repository is now called <code>main</code>,
instead of git's default of <code>master</code>. For now, both branch names
continue to exist, and are kept automatically in sync by a symbolic-ref on the
server. In a few months' time, the alias <code>master</code> will be withdrawn.
<p>
To update a normal downstream clone or checkout to use the new branch name, you
can run commands such as ‘<code>git branch -m master main</code>’ followed by
‘<code>git branch -u origin/main main</code>’.


<p>
<b>2020-06-27 PuTTY 0.74 released</b>


<p>
PuTTY 0.74, released today, is a bug-fix and security release. It
fixes bugs in 0.73, including one possible vulnerability, and also
adds a
<a href="https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.74/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-ssh-prefer-known-hostkeys">new configuration option</a>
to mitigate a minor information leak in SSH host key policy.


<p>
<b>2019-09-29 PuTTY 0.73 released</b>


<p>
PuTTY 0.73, released today, is a bug-fix release. It fixes a small number of bugs since 0.72, and a couple of them have potential security implications.


<p>
<b>2019-07-20 PuTTY 0.72 released</b>


<p>
PuTTY 0.72, released today, is a bug-fix release. It fixes a small
number of further security issues found by the 2019 EU-funded
HackerOne bug bounty, and a variety of other bugs introduced in 0.71.


<p>
<b>2019-07-08 Bug bounty concluded</b>


<p>
The EU-funded bug bounty programme is now closed. Many thanks to
everybody who sent in reports!

<p>
Anyone with a vulnerability to report should now go back to reporting
it in the old way, via email to the PuTTY team, as described on the
<a href="feedback.html">Feedback page</a>.
If you think it needs to be reported confidentially, encrypt it with
our Secure Contact Key.


<p>
<b>2019-03-25 Bug bounty continues</b>


<p>
This year's EU-funded bug bounty programme is <strong>still
running</strong>. It was originally scheduled to end on 7th March, but
there was money left over in the budget. So while that money lasts,
you still have a chance to earn some by finding vulnerabilities in
PuTTY 0.71 or the development snapshots!

<p>
As before, vulnerabilities should be reported through the
<a href="https://hackerone.com/putty_h1c">HackerOne web site</a>
in order to qualify for a bounty: if you send reports directly to the
PuTTY team in the usual way, then we'll still fix them, but we can't
provide money for them.


<p>
<b>2019-03-16 PuTTY 0.71 released</b>


<p>
PuTTY 0.71, released today, includes a large number of security fixes,
many of which were found by the recent EU-funded HackerOne bug bounty.
There are also other security enhancements (side-channel resistance),
and a few new features.

It's also the first release to be built for Windows on Arm.


<p>
<b>2019-01-18 EU bug bounty for finding vulnerabilities in PuTTY</b>


<p>
From now until 7th March, you can earn money by reporting security
vulnerabilities in PuTTY!

<p>
HackerOne is running a <a href="https://hackerone.com/putty_h1c">bug
bounty programme</a> for PuTTY, funded by the European Union as part
of the &lsquo;Free and Open Source Software Audit&rsquo; project
(EU-FOSSA 2). If you report a vulnerability through their web site, it
may qualify for a bounty. (The exact amount will depend on how serious
the problem is, and there's also a bonus for providing a patch that
fixes it.)

<p>
For more details, or if you have something to report, see the link
above.

<p>
(Please note that HackerOne will only consider vulnerabilities
reported <em>to them</em>. If you send a report directly to the PuTTY
team in the usual way, then of course we'll still fix it, but we can't
also arrange for you to get paid.)


<p>
<b>2018-08-25 GPG key rollover</b>


<p>
This week we've generated a fresh set of GPG keys for signing PuTTY
release and snapshot builds. We will begin signing snapshots with the
new snapshot key, and future releases with the new release key. The
new master key is signed with the old master keys, of course. See
the <a href="keys.html">keys page</a> for more information.



<p>
<b>2017-07-08 PuTTY 0.70 released, containing security and bug fixes</b>


<p>
PuTTY 0.70, released today, fixes further problems with Windows DLL
hijacking, and also fixes a small number of bugs in 0.69, including
broken printing support and Unicode keyboard input on Windows.
